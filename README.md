If creating an event in Outlook Desktop (O365) does not trigger the Power Automate Outlook connector (for adding, updating, or deleting events), the issue could be due to one or more of the following reasons:

1. Event Not Synced with Exchange Online
	•	Power Automate relies on Microsoft Graph and Exchange Online to detect changes.
	•	If the event is created in Outlook Desktop (Cached Mode) and is not yet synced to Exchange Online, Power Automate will not detect it.
	•	Solution: Ensure Outlook Desktop is connected to the internet and fully synced. You can check this by creating the event and confirming it appears in Outlook Web (OWA).

2. Power Automate Flow Triggers Only for Primary Calendar
	•	Power Automate’s “When an event is added, updated, or deleted” trigger only works for the primary calendar (default calendar in Outlook).
	•	Solution: Ensure the event is created in the primary calendar, not in a shared or secondary calendar.

3. Cached Mode Delays
	•	If Outlook is running in Cached Exchange Mode, updates might not sync immediately.
	•	Solution: Try disabling Cached Mode:
	1.	Go to File > Account Settings > Account Settings.
	2.	Select your account and click Change.
	3.	Uncheck Use Cached Exchange Mode and restart Outlook.

4. Power Automate Flow Not Configured Correctly
	•	Double-check the trigger in your Power Automate flow:
	•	Ensure the correct Calendar ID is selected.
	•	Test with a manual trigger to confirm Power Automate is functional.

5. API Limitations and Delays
	•	Power Automate may not trigger instantly due to API throttling.
	•	Try waiting a few minutes to see if the event eventually triggers.

6. Incorrect Permissions in Power Automate
	•	Ensure Power Automate has the required Outlook permissions to monitor events.
	•	Reconnect the Outlook connector in Power Automate.

7. Outlook Add-ins or Third-party Sync Issues
	•	Some add-ins or third-party tools may interfere with event synchronization.
	•	Solution: Try disabling unnecessary add-ins and test again.

8. Conditional Filtering in Power Automate
	•	If your flow has filters, ensure they match your event.
	•	Solution: Temporarily remove conditions to see if the trigger fires.

9. Flow Not Turned On or Errors in Execution
	•	Check if the flow is turned on and has no errors in Power Automate Run History.

Would you like help troubleshooting further with a specific test case?

Why Power Automate Flows Fail to Trigger Due to API Throttling?

1. What is API Throttling?

API throttling is a mechanism that Microsoft enforces to limit the number of API requests a user, app, or service can make within a specific timeframe. This prevents excessive load on Microsoft 365 services (such as Outlook, SharePoint, or Dataverse) and ensures fair resource distribution across users.

2. How API Throttling Affects Power Automate Flows?

Power Automate relies on API calls to detect and execute triggers. If the flow exceeds Microsoft’s throttling limits, the following issues can occur:
	•	Delays in triggering: The flow may not run immediately when an event occurs.
	•	Missed triggers: If Power Automate is throttled for an extended period, certain triggers may be skipped entirely.
	•	Flow failures: If Power Automate cannot process requests due to API restrictions, the flow may fail or retry after a delay.

3. Common Reasons for API Throttling in Power Automate
	1.	High Frequency of Trigger Events
	•	If too many events (e.g., Outlook calendar changes, email arrivals) occur in a short period, Power Automate may hit its API limit.
	•	This is common in scenarios where flows monitor frequently updated data sources.
	2.	Excessive API Calls from Multiple Flows
	•	If a user or service account runs multiple flows making frequent API requests to Microsoft 365 services, it can trigger throttling.
	•	Example: Multiple Power Automate flows checking an Outlook inbox every few seconds.
	3.	Shared Microsoft 365 Tenant Limits
	•	If multiple users in the same organization use Power Automate extensively, the overall API quota for the tenant may be reached.
	•	Example: A company-wide automation system using Outlook and SharePoint heavily.
	4.	Large Batch Operations
	•	If a flow processes bulk actions (e.g., sending hundreds of emails, updating thousands of records), the API may throttle requests to avoid overloading the system.
	5.	Connector-specific Limits
	•	Some connectors, like the Office 365 Outlook connector, have specific limits on how often they can poll for data or execute actions.
	•	Example: The Outlook Calendar trigger runs on a polling schedule, and excessive polling can cause throttling.

4. How to Mitigate API Throttling in Power Automate?

✅ Optimize Flow Trigger Frequency
	•	If using a polling trigger (e.g., “When an event is added” in Outlook), reduce the polling interval (e.g., check every 15 minutes instead of every minute).

✅ Use Trigger Conditions to Reduce Unnecessary Executions
	•	Instead of triggering on every event, add conditions to filter out unnecessary runs.
	•	Example: Only trigger a flow when an event has “Important” in the title.

✅ Use Batching Instead of Individual Requests
	•	If your flow processes multiple records, use the “Delay” action or batch API requests to avoid overloading the system.

✅ Monitor Flow Run History & API Usage
	•	Check Power Automate analytics (in the Admin Center) to see if throttling is affecting your flows.

✅ Upgrade to a Higher Power Automate Plan
	•	Microsoft imposes different limits on free vs. premium Power Automate plans.
	•	If your flows frequently hit throttling limits, consider upgrading to a plan with higher API limits.

Would you like help identifying if API throttling is affecting your specific flow?


How to Reduce the Polling Interval in Power Automate?

Polling triggers in Power Automate (such as “When an event is added, updated, or deleted” in Outlook) check for new data at a fixed interval. By reducing the polling frequency, you can decrease API usage and avoid throttling.

Methods to Reduce Polling Frequency:

1. Adjust Trigger Frequency in Power Automate Settings

For triggers like Office 365 Outlook, SharePoint, or Dataverse, you can modify the polling interval:
	1.	Open Your Flow in Power Automate
	2.	Click on the Trigger (e.g., “When an event is added, updated, or deleted”).
	3.	Expand the Settings (click the three dots ... on the trigger).
	4.	Locate the Polling Frequency or Interval option.
	5.	Change the polling interval (e.g., from 1 minute to 15 minutes).
	6.	Save and test the flow.

2. Use “Trigger Conditions” to Reduce Unnecessary Executions

Instead of polling every time, add a condition to trigger the flow only when necessary:
	1.	Click on the Trigger in your flow.
	2.	Open the Settings (... > “Settings”).
	3.	Scroll down to Trigger Conditions and add an expression to filter when the flow should run.
	•	Example: Only trigger when an event contains “Urgent”:

@contains(triggerBody()?['subject'], 'Urgent')


	4.	Click Done, then Save the flow.

This reduces API calls by preventing unnecessary triggers.

3. Use Power Automate Premium (If Needed)

Some premium connectors allow configuring polling intervals directly in the trigger settings. If you are on a standard plan and hitting limits, upgrading may allow more control over polling frequency.

4. Use a Manual or Scheduled Trigger Instead of Polling
	•	If real-time processing is not necessary, replace the polling trigger with a scheduled trigger:
	•	Use the “Recurrence” trigger to run the flow at a set interval (e.g., every 30 minutes).
	•	Combine this with a filter condition to check only recent changes.

Example: Best Practice for Reducing Outlook Polling

Instead of polling every minute for Outlook calendar changes, set:
✅ Polling interval to 15-30 minutes.
✅ Add Trigger Conditions to filter important changes.
✅ Use batch processing to handle multiple events at once.

If deleted events do not trigger, but added and updated events do, in the Power Automate “When an event is added, updated, or deleted” Outlook connector, the issue is likely due to one of the following reasons:

Possible Reasons and Solutions

1. Outlook Sync Delay for Deleted Events
	•	When an event is deleted in Outlook Desktop (O365), it may not sync immediately to Exchange Online.
	•	Power Automate only detects changes once the deletion is processed on the server.
	•	Solution: Check if the event appears in Deleted Items in Outlook Web (OWA). If it is not there, Outlook Desktop might not have synced yet.

2. Deletion Happens in a Non-Primary Calendar
	•	The trigger only works for the primary calendar. If you delete an event from a shared, secondary, or delegated calendar, it won’t trigger the flow.
	•	Solution: Ensure the deletion occurs in the default (primary) Outlook calendar.

3. “Hard Delete” vs. “Soft Delete” Handling
	•	Soft Delete: Moving an event to the Deleted Items folder (this should trigger the flow).
	•	Hard Delete: Permanently deleting an event (Shift + Delete) or auto-emptying Deleted Items may not trigger the flow.
	•	Solution: Try deleting an event normally (not permanently) and check if the flow triggers.

4. API Throttling or Sync Delays
	•	Microsoft limits API requests to prevent overloading Exchange Online.
	•	Sometimes, deletions trigger with a delay due to throttling.
	•	Solution: Wait a few minutes and check the Flow Run History for delayed execution.

5. Power Automate Trigger is Filtering Out Deletions
	•	If the flow has conditions in the trigger settings (e.g., filtering only added/updated events), deletions may be ignored.
	•	Solution:
	•	Open the trigger settings in Power Automate.
	•	Check for any Trigger Conditions that might block deletions.
	•	Remove unnecessary filters and test again.

6. The Flow is Not Listening for Deleted Events Correctly
	•	Some versions of Power Automate’s Outlook connector prioritize “Added” and “Updated” events over “Deleted” events.
	•	Solution:
	•	Create a separate flow with the “When an event is deleted” trigger to isolate the issue.
	•	Test if deletions trigger when handled separately.

Next Steps for Troubleshooting
	1.	Delete an event from Outlook Web (OWA) instead of Outlook Desktop and check if the flow triggers.
	2.	Check Flow Run History in Power Automate for failed/missed triggers.
	3.	Ensure no filters or conditions are blocking the trigger.
	4.	Test with a new flow using only the “When an event is deleted” trigger.

If you cannot add a group calendar under your main calendar groups in Outlook, the issue could be due to one of the following reasons:

Possible Causes & Solutions

1. You Are Using Outlook Desktop in Cached Mode
	•	Outlook Desktop (O365) in Cached Exchange Mode may not sync group calendars correctly.
	•	Solution:
	1.	Open Outlook and go to File > Account Settings > Account Settings.
	2.	Select your Exchange account and click Change.
	3.	Uncheck Use Cached Exchange Mode and restart Outlook.

2. Group Calendars Cannot Be Added to Personal Calendar Groups
	•	Microsoft 365 Groups calendars do not behave like personal calendars and cannot be added under your main calendar groups.
	•	Solution: Instead of adding it under your main calendar groups, access it from:
	•	Outlook Web (OWA) under “Groups” in the calendar pane.
	•	Outlook Desktop under the “Groups” section in the left sidebar.

3. Incorrect Permissions to Access the Group Calendar
	•	If you do not have Full Access to the Microsoft 365 Group, you might not be able to add its calendar.
	•	Solution: Ask an admin or group owner to check your permissions:
	1.	Open Outlook Web (OWA).
	2.	Go to Groups > [Your Group] > Calendar.
	3.	If you cannot see it, request permission from the group owner.

4. Group Calendar Is Not Syncing to Outlook Desktop
	•	Some group calendars are only visible in Outlook Web and do not sync to Outlook Desktop automatically.
	•	Solution:
	1.	Open Outlook Web (OWA).
	2.	Go to Calendar > Groups > Select the Group Calendar.
	3.	Click “Add to Favorites” (this forces sync to Outlook Desktop).
	4.	Restart Outlook Desktop and check if the calendar appears.

5. Microsoft 365 Group Calendar Not Enabled in Outlook
	•	Your organization might have restricted Microsoft 365 Group Calendars in Outlook Desktop.
	•	Solution: Check with your IT administrator if group calendars are enabled for Outlook Desktop.

Alternative Workarounds

✅ Add the Group Calendar as a Shared Calendar
If you want the group calendar to appear alongside your personal calendar:
	1.	Open Outlook Desktop and go to Calendar View.
	2.	Click “Add Calendar” > “From Address Book”.
	3.	Search for the Microsoft 365 Group and add its calendar.

How to Create a Child Flow in Power Automate for Outlook

A child flow in Power Automate is a reusable flow that can be called from a parent flow to modularize complex processes. This is useful in Outlook automation when you want to:
✅ Reuse email-processing logic across multiple flows
✅ Separate event handling (e.g., sending emails, processing attachments)
✅ Reduce duplication and simplify maintenance

Steps to Create a Child Flow in Power Automate (Outlook)

1. Create the Child Flow
	1.	Go to Power Automate (https://flow.microsoft.com)
	2.	Click Create > Instant Cloud Flow
	3.	Choose “Manually trigger a flow” as the trigger
	4.	Click + Add an input to define parameters that the parent flow will pass (e.g., Email Subject, Recipient, Body)
	•	Example:
	•	Text Input: EmailSubject
	•	Text Input: EmailBody
	•	Email Input: RecipientEmail
	5.	Add an action (e.g., Send an email (V2) - Outlook):
	•	To: RecipientEmail
	•	Subject: EmailSubject
	•	Body: EmailBody
	6.	Add a “Respond to a Power Automate or PowerApps” action to return data to the parent flow
	•	Example output: {"Status": "Email Sent Successfully"}
	7.	Save and Turn on the flow

2. Allow the Child Flow to Be Called by Other Flows
	1.	Click on the three dots (...) on the trigger
	2.	Select “Peek code” and check for the "kind": "PowerApp" property
	3.	If missing, manually set the trigger as a Power Automate trigger
	4.	Save again

3. Call the Child Flow from a Parent Flow
	1.	Create a New Automated Flow (Parent Flow)
	2.	Select a Trigger (e.g., “When an event is added, updated, or deleted” in Outlook)
	3.	Click New Step > “Run a Child Flow”
	4.	Select the child flow you created earlier
	5.	Pass the necessary parameters
	•	Example:
	•	EmailSubject = "New Outlook Event Created"
	•	EmailBody = "An event was added to your calendar"
	•	RecipientEmail = user@domain.com
	6.	Optionally, add a step to handle the response from the child flow

Testing the Setup
	•	Create an Outlook event → The parent flow should trigger and call the child flow
	•	Check the Flow Run History in Power Automate to ensure execution
