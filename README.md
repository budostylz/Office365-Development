Yes, you’re correct! To target a specific Outlook calendar when granting edit access, you need to include the Calendar ID in the API endpoint. Below is the correct approach using the Power Automate Outlook connector.

Steps to Grant Edit Access to a Specific Outlook Calendar Using Power Automate

Prerequisites
	•	Ensure the Outlook calendar ID is available.
	•	The user must be the owner of the calendar.
	•	The recipient must be within the same organization.

Step 1: Get the Calendar ID

Before you can modify permissions, you need to retrieve the Calendar ID.
	1.	Add a New Step in Power Automate
	•	Search for “Send an HTTP request (Outlook)” and select it.
	•	Use the following configuration:
	•	Method: GET
	•	URI:

https://outlook.office.com/api/v2.0/me/calendars


	•	Headers:

{
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}


	•	This returns a list of all calendars you own.

	2.	Extract the Calendar ID
	•	Parse the response and locate the ID of the calendar you want to modify.

Step 2: Grant Edit Access to a User

Once you have the Calendar ID, use it in the API call to grant access:
	1.	Add another “Send an HTTP request (Outlook)” action.
	2.	Configure the request as follows:
	•	Method: POST
	•	URI:

https://outlook.office.com/api/v2.0/me/calendars/{calendar_id}/calendarPermissions

	•	Replace {calendar_id} with the actual Calendar ID retrieved in Step 1.

	•	Headers:

{
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}


	•	Body:

{
  "emailAddress": "user@example.com",
  "role": "editor"
}

	•	Replace "user@example.com" with the email of the user to whom you’re granting edit access.

Step 3: Test the Flow
	1.	Save the flow.
	2.	Run it manually (or use a trigger).
	3.	The specified user should now have editor permissions on the targeted Outlook calendar.

Alternative: Using the “Share Calendar” Action

If the HTTP request approach does not work, try:
	1.	Outlook Connector → “Share Calendar” action.
	2.	Select the calendar.
	3.	Enter the recipient’s email.
	4.	Assign edit permission.

Final Notes
	•	The Calendar ID is required in the endpoint to modify permissions for a specific calendar.
	•	Using the Outlook connector’s built-in “Send an HTTP request” prevents the need for premium HTTP connectors.
	•	This method allows automated calendar permission management directly in Power Automate.

Would you like assistance in parsing the Calendar ID dynamically within Power Automate?

When sharing an Outlook calendar using Microsoft Graph API or the Outlook API in Power Automate, you can assign different permission levels to users. Here are the available permission sets:

1. Permission Levels in Outlook API (v2.0)

When granting access to a calendar using the Outlook API, you can assign the following roles:

Role	Access Level
none	No access
freeBusy	Can see when you are busy, but not details of events
limitedDetails	Can see event titles and locations, but not full details
view	Can fully view all calendar details, but not edit
editor	Can view, edit, add, and delete events
delegate	Can view, edit, add, delete events, and respond to meeting requests on behalf of the owner

Example API Request for Setting a Permission:

{
  "emailAddress": "user@example.com",
  "role": "editor"
}

2. Microsoft Graph API Calendar Permission Levels

If using Microsoft Graph API (instead of the Outlook API), these are the available roles:

Role	Description
none	No access
freeBusyRead	Can see free/busy information only
limitedDetails	Can see event subjects, locations, and times, but not full details
read	Full read-only access to calendar
write	Can create, update, and delete events but not share the calendar
delegateWithPrivateEventAccess	Full access, including private events, and can respond to invitations on behalf of the owner
delegateWithoutPrivateEventAccess	Same as delegateWithPrivateEventAccess, but cannot see private events

Example API Request Using Microsoft Graph API:

{
  "emailAddress": {
    "address": "user@example.com"
  },
  "roles": ["write"]
}

3. Default Outlook Web Calendar Sharing Permission Levels

If setting permissions manually via Outlook on the web, the levels are:

Permission Level	What They Can Do
Can view when I’m busy	Only see free/busy times, no details
Can view titles and locations	See event titles and locations but no other details
Can view all details	Full read access, but no edits
Can edit	Can add, modify, and delete events
Can delegate	Can manage events and respond to invites on behalf of the owner

Which Permission Should You Use?
	•	If you only want users to see your availability: freeBusyRead
	•	If they should see event details but not edit: read
	•	If they should edit but not manage: write
	•	If they should fully manage your calendar: delegate

Would you like an example flow for setting up these permissions dynamically in Power Automate?
