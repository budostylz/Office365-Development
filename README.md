Yes, you can copy events from one Outlook calendar to another and update them using Power Automate. Here’s how you can achieve it:

1. Copy Events from One Calendar to Another

To copy events, follow these steps in Power Automate:
	1.	Trigger: Use the “When a new event is created (V4)” trigger for the source calendar.
	2.	Action: Use “Create event (V4)” action to add the event to the target calendar.
	•	Map relevant event details such as:
	•	Subject
	•	Start time
	•	End time
	•	Location
	•	Description
	•	Attendees

2. Update Events in the Target Calendar When Source Events Change

To ensure updates reflect in the target calendar:
	1.	Trigger: Use “When an event is updated (V4)” trigger for the source calendar.
	2.	Action: Use “Get events (V4)” action to retrieve the corresponding event from the target calendar.
	3.	Condition: Check if the event exists in the target calendar.
	4.	Action: Use “Update event (V4)” action to modify the event details.

3. Handle Event Deletion

If you want to delete events from the target calendar when they are removed from the source:
	1.	Trigger: Use “When an event is deleted (V4)” trigger.
	2.	Action: Use “Get events (V4)” to find the corresponding event in the target calendar.
	3.	Action: Use “Delete event (V4)” to remove it.

Notes:
	•	Ensure you have permissions to access both calendars.
	•	If the target calendar is shared, ensure you have the correct delegate access.
	•	Consider using an ID mapping strategy to link source and target events for updates.

Would you like a step-by-step Power Automate flow guide for this?

In Outlook, event color coding is typically controlled through Categories rather than being an inherent property of the event. When copying events from one calendar to another using Power Automate, you can maintain the color coding if the destination calendar supports Categories.

How to Maintain Color Coding When Copying Events
	1.	Extract the Category from the Source Event
	•	In the “When a new event is created (V4)” trigger, retrieve the Categories of the event.
	2.	Assign the Same Category to the Copied Event
	•	When using the “Create event (V4)” action, map the Categories field from the source event.
	3.	Ensure Categories Exist in the Destination Calendar
	•	Outlook categories are user-specific. If the category does not exist in the target calendar, it will not appear correctly.
	•	To ensure consistency, manually add the same color categories to the target calendar under Outlook Settings → Categories.

Limitations
	•	Categories must be manually pre-configured in the destination calendar for the colors to match.
	•	If you are copying between different accounts, the color mappings might differ, even if the category names are the same.
	•	Power Automate cannot directly modify the color overlay settings in Outlook.

Would you like a sample Power Automate flow setup to maintain these categories?

No, you cannot directly move a shared calendar under “My Calendars” in Outlook. However, you can add it as a separate calendar and manage it alongside your calendars. Here are the available options:

Option 1: Add the Shared Calendar to Your Outlook View
	1.	Open Outlook and go to the Calendar view.
	2.	Click on Add Calendar → From Address Book.
	3.	Search for the shared calendar and add it.
	4.	The shared calendar will appear under the Shared Calendars section, but it cannot be moved under “My Calendars.”

Option 2: Overlay View for a Unified Display

If you want the shared calendar to appear visually integrated with your personal calendar:
	1.	Open both your calendar and the shared calendar.
	2.	Click View → Overlay Mode to combine them into a single view.
	3.	This does not move the calendar but helps you see everything in one place.

Option 3: Copy Events to Your Personal Calendar

If you need the events from the shared calendar to appear in your personal calendar:
	1.	Use Power Automate to copy events automatically (as discussed earlier).
	2.	Manually copy events by dragging them from the shared calendar to your own.

Option 4: Request Full Access & Recreate as a Secondary Calendar

If you need complete control:
	1.	Ask the calendar owner to grant Full Access (if using Exchange).
	2.	Export the shared calendar as an ICS file and import it into a new calendar under “My Calendars.”
	•	This creates a static copy but does not sync automatically.

Would you like assistance in setting up Power Automate to copy events for synchronization?


No, Outlook does not provide a built-in option to reorder the “My Calendars” and “Shared Calendars” groups. The default behavior places “My Calendars” at the top, followed by “Shared Calendars.” However, here are some potential workarounds:

1. Collapse “My Calendars” to Reduce Visibility
	•	You can collapse the “My Calendars” section so that “Shared Calendars” is immediately visible.
	•	Click the small arrow next to “My Calendars” to minimize the group.

2. Rename and Customize Calendar Groups

If you want more control over organization:
	•	Create a new calendar group:
	1.	Right-click any existing calendar group.
	2.	Select New Calendar Group.
	3.	Name it something like “Priority Calendars.”
	4.	Drag and drop shared calendars into this new group.
	5.	Move personal calendars to a secondary group.

3. Use Overlay Mode for a Unified View

If your goal is to see shared calendars first in terms of visibility:
	•	Use Calendar Overlay Mode to combine selected calendars in one view, reducing the need to interact with groups.

4. Pin Outlook to Open with Shared Calendars Visible
	•	If your goal is quick access:
	1.	Open Outlook Calendar.
	2.	Ensure the Shared Calendar is selected.
	3.	Close and reopen Outlook— it should remember your last calendar selection.

5. Third-Party Outlook Add-ins
	•	Some Outlook productivity tools or third-party add-ins may offer more customization options for grouping and ordering calendars.

Would you like assistance in setting up a custom calendar group or Power Automate for syncing?

Enhancing Microsoft Outlook’s functionality can significantly boost your productivity and streamline your workflow. Here are some notable third-party add-ins to consider:

You can use Power Automate to automatically copy events from a shared Outlook calendar to a personal calendar. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to set this up:

1. Set Up Power Automate Flow to Copy Events

This flow will trigger when a new event is added to the shared calendar and create the same event in the personal calendar.

Step 1: Create a New Flow
	1.	Go to Power Automate (https://flow.microsoft.com).
	2.	Click Create → Automated cloud flow.
	3.	Name it “Copy Shared Calendar Events to Personal Calendar”.
	4.	Choose “When a new event is created (V4)” as the trigger.

Step 2: Select the Shared Calendar
	1.	In the “When a new event is created (V4)” trigger:
	•	Click Calendar Id.
	•	Choose the Shared Calendar from the list.

Step 3: Add Action to Create Event in Personal Calendar
	1.	Click ”+ New Step”.
	2.	Select “Create event (V4)”.
	3.	Configure the following:
	•	Calendar Id → Choose Personal Calendar.
	•	Subject → Use Subject from the shared event.
	•	Start Time → Use Start from the shared event.
	•	End Time → Use End from the shared event.
	•	Location → Use Location from the shared event.
	•	Body → Use Body from the shared event.
	•	Attendees → Use Attendees from the shared event.
	•	Categories → If color coding is needed, map this field as well.

2. Update Personal Calendar When Shared Calendar Events Change

To ensure updates reflect in the personal calendar:

Step 4: Add Another Flow for Updates
	1.	Create a new Automated cloud flow.
	2.	Select “When an event is updated (V4)” trigger.
	3.	Choose the Shared Calendar as the source.
	4.	Add “Get events (V4)” action to find the corresponding event in the personal calendar.
	5.	Add “Update event (V4)” action to modify the event in the personal calendar.

3. Handle Event Deletions

If an event is deleted from the shared calendar, remove it from the personal calendar:

Step 5: Create a Flow for Event Deletions
	1.	Create a new Automated cloud flow.
	2.	Select “When an event is deleted (V4)” trigger.
	3.	Choose the Shared Calendar.
	4.	Add “Get events (V4)” action to search for the same event in the personal calendar.
	5.	Add “Delete event (V4)” action to remove it.

4. Limitations & Considerations
	•	Shared calendar permissions: You must have at least read & write access to both calendars.
	•	Categories (Color Coding): Categories must exist in the personal calendar for colors to be maintained.
	•	Event Matching: Use unique subject or event ID fields to track updates.
	•	Recurrence Support: This method may not work efficiently for recurring events.

The error message suggests that Outlook does not allow calendar sharing with Office 365 Groups (O365GroupTest@groups.mail.mil) in the same way it does with individuals. Here are some reasons why this might be happening:

Possible Reasons:
	1.	Group Policy Restrictions:
	•	Your organization’s IT administrators may have restricted sharing permissions for Office 365 Groups. They might allow individual sharing but not group-level calendar sharing.
	2.	O365 Group Calendar Sharing Behavior:
	•	Office 365 Groups have their own shared calendars that are accessible by all members. Unlike individual users, groups typically do not receive shared calendar invitations in the same way.
	3.	Exchange Online Plan Limitations:
	•	Some Microsoft 365 plans may restrict external or group-level calendar sharing.
	4.	Default Sharing Settings:
	•	Outlook and Exchange Online may have different default permissions for sharing with individuals vs. groups. Group-based sharing may require explicit permissions.
	5.	Recipient Type Mismatch:
	•	If O365GroupTest@groups.mail.mil is a distribution list or security group rather than a true Office 365 Group, calendar sharing will not work.

Possible Solutions:
	•	Check Your Organization’s Policies:
Contact your IT department to verify if group-level calendar sharing is allowed.
	•	Manually Add the Group Members:
Instead of sharing the calendar with the group, add individual members manually.
	•	Use the Office 365 Group Calendar Instead:
If you want all group members to see a shared calendar, have them access the group’s calendar from the Outlook web or desktop app.
	•	Verify Exchange Online Admin Settings:
Admins can check the Exchange Admin Center → Recipients → Groups → Select the Group → Settings → Calendar Permissions.
	•	Use PowerShell to Check Permissions:
If you have administrative access, use PowerShell to verify and modify sharing settings:

Get-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity user@domain.com:\Calendar

To allow sharing:

Set-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity user@domain.com:\Calendar -User "O365GroupTest@groups.mail.mil" -AccessRights Editor



Would you like assistance checking any of these settings?


The inability to pull Office 365 Group calendars into Power Automate while being able to access your personal calendar is likely due to a combination of API limitations, permissions, and the way group calendars are structured within Microsoft 365. Below are the key reasons:

1. Graph API vs. Outlook Calendar Connector Limitation
	•	Power Automate primarily interacts with Outlook calendars via the Microsoft Graph API.
	•	Personal calendars are directly associated with user mailboxes and can be accessed using /me/calendar endpoints.
	•	Group calendars belong to an Office 365 Group, and they require different API calls (/groups/{group-id}/calendar), which are not fully supported in Power Automate’s built-in Office 365 Outlook connector.

2. Permissions Issue
	•	When using Power Automate, it executes actions under your user account, which has access to personal calendars but might not have sufficient permissions to access a Group Calendar.
	•	Office 365 Group calendars require different permission levels, such as Group.Read.All or Calendars.ReadWrite, which are not always granted by default.
	•	Even if you are a member of the group, Power Automate may not recognize your permissions for the group calendar unless explicitly granted.

3. Office 365 Groups Calendars Are Shared Resources
	•	Unlike personal calendars, Group calendars are considered shared resources in Exchange Online.
	•	The Power Automate “Get Events” action does not directly support shared resource calendars.

4. Power Automate Connector Doesn’t Support Group Calendars Natively
	•	The Office 365 Outlook connector in Power Automate is designed primarily for user mailboxes, not shared or group calendars.
	•	Group calendars require Microsoft Graph API calls or an advanced workaround to access.

✅ Workarounds to Pull Office 365 Group Calendar Events in Power Automate

Option 1: Use Microsoft Graph API via HTTP Request in Power Automate

Instead of the built-in Outlook connector, use an HTTP request action to call Microsoft Graph API:
	1.	Use the HTTP Request action in Power Automate.
	2.	Make a GET request to retrieve group calendar events:

GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups/{group-id}/calendar/events


	3.	Replace {group-id} with the actual Group ID.
	4.	You may need to register an Azure AD app and grant it Group.Read.All permissions.
	5.	Parse the JSON response and use the data in your flow.

Option 2: Use a Shared Mailbox Instead of a Group Calendar
	1.	If possible, create a Shared Mailbox instead of an O365 Group.
	2.	Grant necessary permissions to access the shared mailbox’s calendar.
	3.	Use Power Automate to pull calendar events from the shared mailbox.

Option 3: Use an Outlook Calendar Workaround
	1.	Add the Group Calendar to your own calendar list in Outlook.
	2.	Share the Group Calendar with yourself and set permissions to “Can Edit.”
	3.	Use Power Automate’s “Get Events” from the shared calendar (since it’s now linked to your account).

Final Thoughts
	•	If Microsoft Graph API is an option for your environment, that is the best way to access Group calendars in Power Automate.

To get the Office 365 Group ID, you can use several methods, depending on your access and tools available. Here are some common ways:

1. Get the Group ID via Microsoft Graph API (Recommended)

If you have access to Microsoft Graph Explorer or can run API requests in Power Automate, follow these steps:

Steps to Retrieve Group ID using Microsoft Graph API
	1.	Go to Microsoft Graph Explorer
	2.	Sign in with your Office 365 account.
	3.	In the query bar, enter:

GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups


	4.	Click Run Query.
	5.	Look for the desired group in the response and find the “id” field.

Example response:

{
    "value": [
        {
            "id": "12345678-abcd-efgh-ijkl-9876543210mn",
            "displayName": "O365GroupTest",
            "mail": "O365GroupTest@groups.mail.mil"
        }
    ]
}

	•	The id is your Group ID.

2. Get the Group ID via PowerShell

If you have Exchange Online PowerShell access, use this command:

Steps
	1.	Open PowerShell and connect to Exchange Online:

Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName youradmin@yourdomain.com


	2.	Run the following command to list all groups:

Get-UnifiedGroup | Select DisplayName, Alias, ExternalDirectoryObjectId


	3.	Look for the group O365GroupTest in the output.
	4.	The ExternalDirectoryObjectId is the Group ID.

3. Get the Group ID from the Microsoft 365 Admin Center
	1.	Go to Microsoft 365 Admin Center (https://admin.microsoft.com).
	2.	Navigate to Teams & groups → Active teams & groups.
	3.	Select the Office 365 Group you need.
	4.	Click on the group and look at the URL in the browser.
	5.	The Group ID is in the URL, like this:

https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/groups/GroupDetails/12345678-abcd-efgh-ijkl-9876543210mn

	•	The long alphanumeric string at the end is the Group ID.

4. Get the Group ID via Azure AD
	1.	Go to Azure AD Admin Center (https://portal.azure.com).
	2.	Navigate to Azure Active Directory → Groups.
	3.	Find the O365 Group and open its properties.
	4.	The Object ID listed is the Group ID.

Final Notes
	•	If you are using Power Automate, you will need the Graph API method.
	•	If you prefer PowerShell, use Get-UnifiedGroup for Exchange Online.
	•	The Admin Center methods are easy if you have admin access.
