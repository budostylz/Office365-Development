Yes, you can overlay multiple calendars into one in Microsoft Outlook (O365). Here’s how:

Using Calendar Overlay in Outlook (Desktop App)
	1.	Open Outlook and go to the Calendar view.
	2.	In the left navigation panel, check the boxes for the calendars you want to overlay.
	3.	The calendars will appear side by side. To overlay them:
	•	Click on the View tab.
	•	Click Overlay Mode (found in the “Arrange” group).
	•	The calendars will now appear merged into one view.
	4.	Repeat step 3 for each calendar you want to overlay.

Using Outlook on the Web (OWA)
	1.	Go to Outlook on the Web.
	2.	Click on the Calendar icon in the left panel.
	3.	Under My Calendars, check multiple calendars.
	4.	Click the View options (gear icon) in the top-right corner and ensure Overlay mode is enabled.

Other Options

If Outlook’s built-in overlay isn’t enough, consider these alternatives:
	•	Microsoft Power Automate: Sync multiple calendar events into a single shared calendar.
	•	Microsoft 365 Groups: Create a shared calendar for all team events.
	•	Third-party Tools: Apps like CalendarBridge or Sync2 Cloud allow cross-platform calendar merging.

Would you like guidance on automation using Power Automate?

You can use Microsoft Power Automate to automatically sync events from multiple Outlook calendars into a single shared calendar. Follow these steps:

Step 1: Set Up Your Power Automate Flow
	1.	Go to Power Automate.
	2.	Click Create → Automated cloud flow.
	3.	Give your flow a name (e.g., “Sync Multiple Calendars”).
	4.	Choose “When an event is added, updated, or deleted” (from Office 365 Outlook) as the trigger.
	5.	Click Create.

Step 2: Configure the Trigger (Source Calendar)
	1.	In the Trigger Settings, select the first source calendar.
	2.	Under Change Type, select Created or Updated (so that new and modified events sync).
	3.	Click + New step.

Step 3: Create an Event in the Shared Calendar
	1.	Search for “Office 365 Outlook” and select “Create event (V4)”.
	2.	Under Calendar ID, select the shared calendar where events should be copied.
	3.	Map fields from the source event to the new event:
	•	Subject → Dynamic Content: Subject
	•	Start time → Dynamic Content: Start time
	•	End time → Dynamic Content: End time
	•	Location → Dynamic Content: Location
	•	Body → Dynamic Content: Body
	4.	Click Save.

Step 4: Add Another Calendar to Sync
	1.	Click + New step.
	2.	Add another “When an event is added, updated, or deleted” trigger for the second calendar.
	3.	Repeat Step 3 to create events in the shared calendar.

Step 5: Handle Deleted Events (Optional)

To remove deleted events from the shared calendar:
	1.	Add a new “When an event is deleted” trigger for each source calendar.
	2.	Use the “Delete event (V2)” action to remove it from the shared calendar.

Step 6: Test and Enable Your Flow
	1.	Click Test (top-right corner) and create a test event in one of your source calendars.
	2.	Check if the event appears in the shared calendar.
	3.	If everything works, click Turn on to activate the flow.

Alternative: Sync with Google Calendar

If you also use Google Calendar, you can add another step to “Create event in Google Calendar” using the Google Calendar connector.

Would you like additional features, such as color-coding based on the original calendar?

You can use Microsoft 365 Groups to create a shared calendar for team events. Follow these steps:

Step 1: Create a Microsoft 365 Group
	1.	Open Outlook (Web or Desktop App).
	2.	Click on New Group:
	•	In Outlook Web:
	•	Click the People icon in the left navigation bar.
	•	Click New Group.
	•	In Outlook Desktop:
	•	Go to the Home tab and click New Group.
	3.	Enter Group Details:
	•	Group Name (e.g., “Team Events Calendar”).
	•	Group Email Address (optional).
	•	Privacy Settings: Choose Public (anyone in the org can join) or Private (only invited members can access).
	•	Click Create.

Step 2: Access the Shared Calendar
	1.	Once the group is created, go to Outlook Calendar.
	2.	In the left panel, under Groups, select your newly created group.
	3.	The shared calendar will now be visible, and any member can add, edit, or view events.

Step 3: Add Members to the Group
	1.	Open Outlook Web and go to the People section.
	2.	Find your Group under Groups you own.
	3.	Click Add Members.
	4.	Search and select team members.
	5.	Click Save.

Step 4: Add Events to the Shared Calendar
	1.	Open the Group Calendar in Outlook.
	2.	Click New Event.
	3.	Enter event details and choose to send invitations to group members.
	4.	Click Save.

Step 5: Make the Shared Calendar Easily Accessible
	•	In Outlook Web, pin the group calendar by clicking the star next to it.
	•	In Outlook Desktop, right-click the group calendar and select Add to Favorites.

Additional Options
	•	Sync with Power Automate: Automatically copy group calendar events to personal calendars.
	•	Use Microsoft Teams: Integrate with Teams for event notifications.

Would you like instructions on syncing the shared calendar with individual calendars?
