We require three additional calendar accounts to support our battle rhythm automation, mirroring the structure of our current DISA NNSY J-6 Mailbox JECC Battle Rhythm. The requested calendars are:

DISA NNSY J-6 Mailbox JECC Engagements

DISA NNSY J-6 Mailbox JCSE Key Events

DISA NNSY J-6 Mailbox JPSE Key Events

These additional calendars will enhance our ability to support mission planning, coordination, and analytcs.
